Feel free to disabled developer mode after the install process.

Congrats! You can use Dark Viewer as a toggle button on any website on chrome, and it will attempt to turn the page into dark mode.

It will also save the setting you had on that page, so you won't need to toggle it back on next time you visit the page.
